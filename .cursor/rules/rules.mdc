Read prd.md first before editing.

Do not generate package.json, vite.config.js, or install npm modules. Use CDN imports only.

Structure:

index.html
css/style.css (if needed, though Tailwind handles most styling)
js/animations.js
js/form.js
assets/


Use Tailwind utilities (via CDN config block). If a repeated class pattern occurs, extend Tailwind via tailwind.config = { theme: { extend: { ... } } } in the CDN script.

Import GSAP + ScrollTrigger via CDN. Keep all animations in js/animations.js.

Accessibility-first (aria labels, alt text, semantic HTML).

Animations must follow PRD. Do not add effects not listed.

For forms, implement front-end only. If no backend, mock with console log + placeholder alert.

Optimize for performance: lazy-load images, compress to WebP, and keep scripts at the bottom with defer.Read prd.md first before editing.

Always use realistic, professional marketing copy (not “Lorem ipsum”).

Only images use placeholders (e.g., /assets/solar-home.jpg, /assets/business-install.jpg).

Copy tone: clear, trustworthy, solution-driven, aimed at homeowners + businesses.

Keep sections structured as in the PRD.

Animations enhance, not distract.
